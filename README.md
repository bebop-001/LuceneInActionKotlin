# Lucene In Action

This is (some) of the code from the book
<a href="https://www.manning.com/books/lucene-in-action-second-edition">
Lucene In Action</a> by
Michael McCandless, Erik Hatcher, and Otis GospodnetiÄ‡the book.

I need to implement search of English for an Android project
I'm working on and from what I've read, full text in Lucene
is more effective than in SQL, so I am looking at implementing
that part of the project in Lucene. 

This is an Android
project though so I need to be careful about memory and I
won't need many of the features added in more recent versions
of Lucene.  For that reason I'm using the 3.6.2 release of
Lucene.

I have been using Kotlin lately and like it.  I'm from
a background of C and PERL so the language fits me
better than Java.

Most of the code is an implementation of the source from 
the book converted to Kotlin.  I'm currently using
the the 2021.1 version of IntelliJ Community IDE with
Kotlin 1.4.2 and Java 11.  You'll find a list of the .jar
files I am currently using in Dependencies.md.

I will also be implementing some other utils to make sure
I understand what I'm doing.
